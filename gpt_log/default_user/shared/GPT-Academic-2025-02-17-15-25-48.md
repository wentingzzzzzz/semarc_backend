This stage extracts the structure and semantics of the code, enabling subsequent analysis. The filter uses Python's parsing libraries to handle different Python constructs such as classes, functions, and loops."

It should be resilient to malformed code or syntax errors, providing clear error messages. It needs to be scalable and able to process code from various Python versions."

It also provides data that could be used by error handling and control flow graph construction components. The Code Parsing Filter must synchronize with the other filters to ensure the sequential processing of Python code."

This stage identifies dependencies and can visualize the relationships between different code components."
