It processes data outputs from the analysis layer and presents them in a comprehensible format, such as graphs or charts. It facilitates user interaction with the results, offering real-time rendering of the analysis data."

It should scale efficiently to handle large visual outputs, ensuring smooth transitions and interactions with the user interface. It also needs to be highly responsive to changes, such as dynamically adjusting the visual output when the user manipulates the data view."
